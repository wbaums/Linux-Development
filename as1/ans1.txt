1. What shell command uses the man program to print all the commands that have a specific word in their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? (hint: man man)

man -k find

2. Where are the mv and sh programs located in the file system? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

/bin/mv, which mv, /bin/sh, which sh

3. What executable programs in /usr/bin have names that are exactly two characters long and end in r, and what do they do? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

man -k ^.r$

4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, which file actually is executed? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

When I execute the command /usr/bin/emacs it is the same as running the executable file emacs which is stored in /usr/bin. 

5. What is the version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program? of the plain gcc program? Why are they different programs?

I used gcc -v and /usr/bin/gcc -v to check the version numbers of both programs. 
the version number of /usr/bin/gcc was 4.8.5 and the version number of the plain gcc program was 4.8.5. I then used which gcc
and found that the executable gcc is located in /usr/lib64/ccache/gcc which is different from /usr/bin/gcc. The usr/bin/gcc is 
an older version while /usr/lib64/ccache/gcc is the one currently used on my seasnet. 

6. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w mean, in terms of permissions?

+ is used to add a permission while - is used to remove a permission. So, u+sx gives the user permission to execute and sets the
group and user id. The o-w removes permission to write for the owner. 

7. Use the find command to find all directories modified in the last four weeks that are located under (or are the same as) the directory /usr/local/cs. List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

First I used man find to figure out what option would let me locate these files. I used -type d to specify directories and -mtime2
28 because 28 * 24 is equal to 4 weeks. Then I added the directory so the whole command was man find usr/local/cs -type d -mtime
28. No directories were modified within the last 4 weeks. 

8. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic links? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

I first used $ cd /usr/bin to navigate to the correct directory. Then I used the command $ ls -l | grep ^l | wc to count the number of files that are symbolic links, and the result was : 
  303    3333   24180. 

9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib64 directory? Use the last-modified time to determine age. Specify the name of the file without the /usr/lib64/ prefix. Consider files whose names start with ".". List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

First I navigated into the /usr/lib64 directory using $ cd usr/lib64. Then I used the command ls -t to sort by last modified time and the last file modified was librom1394.so.0.3.0

10. Where does the locale command get its data from? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

I first used $ man locale. Then I used $ whereis locale which gave the locations of the files for the locale command. 
locale: /usr/bin/locale /usr/lib/locale /etc/locale.conf /usr/include/locale.h /usr/share/locale /usr/share/man/man7/locale.7.gz /usr/share/man/man3/locale.3pm.gz /usr/share/man/man5/locale.5.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/locale.1p.gz

11. In Emacs, what commands have downcase in their name? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

Fist I used $ emacs to open emacs. then I typed C-h, the get-help function. Then I typed downcase to search for the commands with a downcase in their name. 

12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-r through C-M-v do? Can you list their actions concisely? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

I first opened emacs using $ emacs. Then I typed C-h ? to open up the help menu. I then typed c to select CODING. 
Then I typed the given keystrokes. 
C-M-r:	C-M-r runs the command isearch-backward-regexp
C-M-s: C-M-s runs the command isearch-forward-regrexp
C-M-t: C-M-t runs the command transpose-sexps
C-M-u: C-M-u runs the command backward-up-list
C-M-v: C-M-v runs the command scroll-other-window

13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

I did the same thing as for the previous question. $ emacs. Then I opened the get-help menu with C-h and selected c CODING. Then I searched C-g: C-g runs the command keyboard-quit. I also searched C-g through the functions menu found this:
keyboard-quit is an interactive compiled Lisp function.

It is bound to C-g.

(keyboard-quit)

Signal a `quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. What does the Emacs yank function do, and how can you easily invoke it using keystrokes? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

I used $ emacs to open emacs. Then I used C-h f yank to open the description of the yank function:
yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function.

It is bound to C-y meaning that it can be called by typing C-y. 

15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command? List any shell or Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

first I used $ cd /usr/bin to enter the bin directory. Then I typed $ ls -l, which listed everything in the bin directory in long form. Then I opened emacs using $ emacs, C-h d dired: 
In Dired, you are "editing" a list of the files in a directory and
  (optionally) its subdirectories, in the format of `ls -lR'. 

The difference is that the dired command can optionally also show the subdirectories, unlike the ls -l command.
