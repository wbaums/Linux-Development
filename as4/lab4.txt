lab 4 log

I begin by downloading the tar file "coreutils-with-bug.tar" onto my computer.
I make it into a folder and add it into my lab 4 directory using cyberduck.
Then I navigate into the directory coreutils-with-bug and try to configure:
     $ ./configure
Permission is denied so I have to change the permissions to allow execution:
     $ chmod u+x configure
Now I configure and try to make, make install:
    $ ./configure
    $ make
When I run the make command I get an error:

In file included from utimecmp.c:41:
utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
    2 | int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
      |     ^~~~~~~~

                 from utimecmp.c:25:

This error can be resolved by installing the patch.
