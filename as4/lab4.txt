lab 4 log

I begin by downloading the tar file "coreutils-with-bug.tar" onto my computer.
I make it into a folder and add it into my lab 4 directory using cyberduck.
Then I navigate into the directory coreutils-with-bug and try to configure:
     $ ./configure
Permission is denied so I have to change the permissions to allow execution:
     $ chmod u+x configure
Now I configure and try to make, make install:
    $ ./configure
    $ make
