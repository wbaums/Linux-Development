First, I download the tar using the wget command: 
       $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

Then I need to verify its signiture so I download:
     $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
     $ wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

Then I verify its signature using the command:
     $ gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
which returns the following:

gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: /u/eng/class/classwba/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

This verification may not have worked because the signature of the key downloaded is
not trusted.

Now I unzip the tar file:
    $ tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
which creates the directory with my files: coreutils-8.29

I use the command 
    $ cat INSTALL
to figure out how to make and install.

As specified, I use the following shell command to configure, build and install the package:
    $ ./configure && make && make install
Which takes a while to finish. I get the following errors:

src/ginstall: cannot create regular file '/usr/local/bin/./install': Permission denied
make[3]: *** [install-binPROGRAMS] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/w/home.20/class/classwba/Documents/35l/as3/coreutils-8.29'
make[2]: *** [install-am] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/w/home.20/class/classwba/Documents/35l/as3/coreutils-8.29'
make[1]: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/w/home.20/class/classwba/Documents/35l/as3/coreutils-8.29'
make: *** [install] Error 2

In my first attempt I forgot about --prefix so I run:
   $ ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classwba/Documents/35l/as3/UtilsInstall
   $ make
   $ make install
This worked with no errors.
I then navigate into the direcotry UtilsInstall which contains three other 
directories: bin, libexec, share
I enter the bin directory and test the ls command to diagnose the problem:
  $ ls -a -A -l
which prints out:

drwxr-xr-x 2 classwba class   8192 Feb  1 13:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 classwba class   4096 Feb  1 13:22 ..

-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 267416 Feb  1 13:22 chmod
.....
We can see here that it is showing . and .. which it should not do.

I create a patch file within coreutils-8.29 and copy and paste the contents of the patch from Bug#30963 message #10. I apply the patch using the following command
  $ patch -w -p1 < patch.diff
It outputs: 
patching file NEWS
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).

Hunk #1 FAILED at 575.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file tests/local.mk.rej
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh
patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line

This still works because the file we needed to patch succeeded.
Now I reconfigure and remake in case anything else was changed:
    $ autoreconf -f
    $ make 
Now we can check the ls command in the same directory as before to see if the patch changed the output:
    $ ls -a -A -l

-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 186744 Feb  1 13:22 [
-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 286368 Feb  1 13:22 b2sum
-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 179016 Feb  1 13:22 base32
-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 178096 Feb  1 13:22 base64
-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 142168 Feb  1 13:22 basename

-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 294272 Feb  1 13:22 chcon
-rwxr-xr-x 1 classwba class 286792 Feb  1 13:22 chgrp
....

We can see that the . and .. files are gone. This means that the -A command is now overriding the -a command as it should. The patch was successful.
