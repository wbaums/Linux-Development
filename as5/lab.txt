First I have to write a program tr2b.c that transliterates bytes using getchar
and putchar. The implementation is supposed to be a main program that takes two
operands "from" and "two" that are byte strings of the same length.

First I need to figure out how to organize the main function to take these
arguments. I need to use the following structure:
int main(int argc, char **argv
where argc is the number of operands and argv is a pointer to the operands.
